# Walter Mendez - Developer Page

This is the repository for my personal website, created to showcase my projects and development experiments. The site is hosted on **GitHub Pages** with the custom domain [soywaltermendez.dev](https://soywaltermendez.dev).

## Description

The site is built using basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). It's designed to be a simple, clean space to share some of my projects and resources.

## Usage

You can clone this repository and modify the files as needed. The structure is simple:

- `index.html`: The main page of the website.
- `styles/`: Folder containing CSS styles.
- `scripts/`: Folder for JavaScript files.

## Domain Setup

The site is configured to be accessible via the custom domain **soywaltermendez.dev**, using the appropriate DNS records:

- **A Records**: For direct domain resolution.
- **CNAME Record**: To redirect traffic from `www` to the main domain.
